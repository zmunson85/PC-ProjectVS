            <p class="firstPara">LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General
                revealed
                that the CIA has
                mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
                highlighters.
            </p>
            <p class="secondPara">According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most
                crucial
                passages"—are marred
                by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting
                policy
                that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
            <p class="thirdPara">CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will
                probably never know the
                particulars of
                several historic events, such as:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
